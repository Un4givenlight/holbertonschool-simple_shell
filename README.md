## Simple Shell
* is a programming project that involves creating a basic command-line interpreter, similar to the Unix shell. The goal is to understand how shells work by implementing core functionalities such as:
    * Displaying a prompt
    * Reading and parsing user input
    * Executing built-in and external commands
    * Handling errors and process management

## Features
* Feature 1: lets you type commands, runs them, and shows the output. It repeats this until you quit. It's like a mini version of bash or cmd.
* Feature 2:  lets users interact with the operating system by typing commands. It’s used to run programs, manage files, and automate tasks, all through text. It’s basic but powerful for controlling the system directly.
* Feature 3: is its ability to directly execute system commands by interpreting user input and interacting with the operating system at a low level. Unlike graphical interfaces, it allows for precise control over processes, file manipulation, and automation through scripting, using just text.
