## Simple Shell
is a programming project that involves creating a basic command-line interpreter, similar to the Unix shell. The goal is to understand how shells work by implementing core functionalities such as:
    * Displaying a prompt
    * Reading and parsing user input
    * Executing built-in and external commands
    * Handling errors and process management
